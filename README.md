🚧 Road Accident Dashboard (Excel)

An interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard that analyzes road accident casualties across severity, vehicle type, road conditions, location, and time to support road safety insights.

📌 Problem Statement

Road accidents result in thousands of casualties every year.
However, accident data is often stored in large Excel sheets, making it difficult to:

Understand accident severity distribution

Identify high-risk vehicle types

Analyze trends over time

Compare urban vs rural accident impact

This project transforms raw accident data into a clear, insight-driven Excel dashboard.

💡 Solution Overview

This Excel dashboard provides a single-page analytical view of road accident data using:

KPI cards

Charts and pivot tables

Slicers and timelines

It enables quick identification of high-risk factors and accident patterns.

📊 Key KPIs

Total Casualties: 417,883

Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)

Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)

Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)

Car Casualties: 33,348 (79.8%)

🧠 Key Insights
🔹 Casualty Severity

Majority of casualties are slight injuries

Fatal cases form a small but critical percentage

🔹 Vehicle Type Analysis

Cars contribute the highest number of casualties

Bicycles and motorcycles also show significant impact

Heavy vehicles contribute comparatively less

🔹 Year-wise Trend

Monthly comparison of current year vs previous year

Accident counts peak during mid-year and late-year months
